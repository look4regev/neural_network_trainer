# Multi-Layered Neural Network trained by back propagation.
In this project, you are asked to design and develop in python a simple neural network which will be trained using the regular Backpropagation algorithm.
To test your network it is recommended use the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html) data set for training, validation and testing. In a more advanced steps you may use the [CIFAR 10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
The neural network will be developed in a flexible manner to enable future use in the next project.
This will done by enabling:
1. different number of layers and different neurons in each layer
2. different cost functions
3. different regularization techniques
Code your own project in order to be able to do required changes, as you desire. It is prohibited to  use a third party code which will limit your hands for developing additional tasks in this project and in later projects.
